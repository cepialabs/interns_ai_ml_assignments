## 📌 Assignment (from provided sheet)

**Dataset:** Customer Churn *(intentionally messy)*  

### Issues mentioned:
- Missing age values  
- Duplicate rows  
- Inconsistent gender formats  
- Salary outliers  

### Task:
> **“Clean this dataset so it is ready for machine learning.”**

## 🔧 Tasks I Performed in Notebook

1. Filled missing Age values using median  
2. Removed duplicate records  
3. Standardized Gender text formats  
4. Detected and removed salary outliers using IQR  
5. Encoded categorical variables (Geography, Gender)  
6. Scaled numerical features using Min-Max scaling  
7. Created a new feature (BalanceSalaryRatio)  
8. Saved the cleaned dataset for ML use

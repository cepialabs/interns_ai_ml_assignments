# Exploratory Data Analysis of Netflix Titles Dataset

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of an internship assignment with the aim of performing exploratory data analysis on the Netflix Titles dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding content distribution, genre popularity, production trends, and growth patterns of Netflix’s catalog.

## Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows:
- To identify the top 10 most frequently occurring genres on Netflix
- To compare the number of Movies and TV Shows available on the platform
- To analyze the yearly trend of content additions on Netflix
- To determine the country contributing the highest number of titles

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains metadata related to Netflix titles, including:
- Content type (Movie / TV Show)
- Genre categories
- Country of origin
- Date added to the Netflix platform
- Release year and duration

## Approach and Methodology
- Imported and analyzed the dataset using the Pandas library
- Preprocessed textual columns such as genres and countries by splitting and normalizing data
- Extracted year-wise information from the date_added column
- Visualized results using Matplotlib to enhance interpretability

## Technologies Used
- Python programming language
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis execution
- GitHub for version control and project management

## Key Findings
- Netflix’s catalog contains more Movies than TV Shows
- Drama-related genres dominate the platform
- Content addition has increased steadily in recent years
- The United States is the largest producer of Netflix content

## Folder Structure
- `assignment-1.ipynb` – Notebook containing code and analysis
- `netflix.csv` – Dataset file
- `README.md` – Documentation for the project

## Learning Outcomes
This project strengthened practical skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. It also provided hands-on experience with real-world datasets and version control using Git and GitHub.

## Conclusion
The analysis offers meaningful insights into Netflix’s content trends and demonstrates the effective application of Python-based data analysis techniques in a real-world.

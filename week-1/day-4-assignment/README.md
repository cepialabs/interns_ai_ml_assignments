## 🎯 Tasks Performed
The following visualizations were created as part of the assignment:

1. **Score Distribution Plot**  
   - Visualizes how student scores are distributed across the dataset.

2. **Gender vs Performance Chart**  
   - Compares student performance based on gender using a box plot.

3. **Correlation Heatmap**  
   - Displays the correlation between numerical features such as attendance and score.

4. **Attendance vs Score Trend Chart**  
   - Shows the relationship between attendance percentage and student scores using a scatter plot with a trend line.

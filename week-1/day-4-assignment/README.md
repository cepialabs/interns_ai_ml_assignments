Date:22-01-2026
Intern ID: INT2026-1462  
Day: 4  
Topic: Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn  

---

##  Dataset Used
Dataset Name: Student Performance Dataset  
File Name:student_performance_dataset.csv

---

##  Objective
The objective of this assignment is to perform data visualization on the Student Performance dataset and generate meaningful insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

---

##  Tasks Completed

### 1) Score Distribution Plot
- Visualized the distribution of student scores  
- Helps understand overall performance spread (low / average / high)

### 2) Gender vs Performance Chart
- Compared performance of students based on gender  
- Helps identify performance differences between groups

### 3) Correlation Heatmap
- Created a heatmap to show correlations between numeric features  
- Helps identify relationships between variables (e.g., attendance, scores, etc.)

### 4) Attendance vs Score Trend Chart
- Analyzed the trend between student attendance and score  
- Helps understand whether higher attendance impacts performance

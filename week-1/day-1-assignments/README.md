## Assignment: House Price Analysis

This folder contains the assignment file for **Week 1, Day 1**.

---

### Assignment Description

This assignment focuses on **generating random house prices**, calculating statistics, removing outliers, and visualizing the results using Python libraries **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.

The tasks include:

1. **Generate 10,000 random house prices** in the range of ₹10,00,000 to ₹1,00,00,000 using **NumPy**.  
2. **Calculate the average house price**.  
3. **Remove outliers** using the **Interquartile Range (IQR) method**.  
4. **Visualize the price distribution** without outliers using **Matplotlib**.  

---

### Files

- `assignment-1.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing all code, calculations, and visualizations.  

---

### Instructions

1. Open the `assignment-1.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.  
2. Run all the cells sequentially to see the outputs.  
3. Do not modify the folder structure. 
---

### Notes

- The dataset is **simulated using NumPy**, so outputs may vary slightly on each run.  
- Outliers are removed to make the price distribution more realistic.  
- Visualizations are included to help understand the distribution of house prices.  
- Keep all changes committed to GitHub under the same folder structure.

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, you will learn:  

- Generating random datasets using **NumPy**  
- Calculating basic statistics like **mean/average**  
- Identifying and removing **outliers using IQR**  
- Visualizing data using **Matplotlib**  
- Organizing code and files in proper folder structure

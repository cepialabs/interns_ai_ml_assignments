# Student Performance Analysis 

## Dataset
**Student Performance Dataset (student-mat.csv)**  
This dataset contains academic, demographic, and social information of students.

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to analyze student performance using data visualization techniques.

## Tasks Performed

# 1. Score Distribution Plot
- Visualized the distribution of final scores (`G3`)
- Helps understand overall student performance spread

# 2. Gender vs Performance
- Compared average final scores of male and female students
- Used bar chart for comparison

# 3. Correlation Heatmap
- Analyzed relationships between numerical features
- Found strong correlation between `G1`, `G2`, and `G3`

# 4. Attendance vs Score Trend
- Used absences as a measure of attendance
- Observed a negative relationship between absences and final scores

# Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Conclusion
- Most students score in the mid-range of final grades.
- Gender shows slight variation in average performance.
- Previous grades strongly influence final performance.
- Higher absences generally result in lower scores.

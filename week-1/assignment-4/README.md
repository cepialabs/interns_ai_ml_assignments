📊 Student Performance Data Visualization Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a Student Performance Dataset and visualizes key academic trends using Python.
The goal is to understand score distributions, gender-based performance differences, correlations between variables, and the relationship between attendance and academic performance.

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset is synthetically generated within the code and contains 100 student records with the following attributes:

Column Name	Description
StudentID	Unique student identifier
Gender	Student gender (Male/Female)
Attendance	Attendance percentage (60–100%)
StudyHours	Daily study hours
MathScore	Mathematics score
ReadingScore	Reading score
WritingScore	Writing score
TotalScore	Average of Math, Reading, and Writing scores
🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📈 Visualizations Implemented
1️⃣ Score Distribution Plot

Displays the distribution of students’ average scores using a histogram with a density curve.

2️⃣ Gender vs Performance Chart

Compares academic performance between genders using a box plot.

3️⃣ Correlation Heatmap

Shows correlations between attendance, study hours, subject scores, and overall performance.

4️⃣ Attendance vs Score Trend Chart

Illustrates the relationship between attendance percentage and average score using a regression trend line.

▶️ How to Run the Project

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the dataset and visualization code.

The plots will be displayed automatically.

📊 Key Insights

Student scores follow a roughly normal distribution.

Performance differences between genders can be visually compared.

Attendance and study hours show positive correlation with academic performance.

Strong correlations exist between individual subject scores and total score.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Use a real-world student performance dataset

Add subject-wise trend analysis

Implement machine learning models for score prediction

Export visualizations as image files

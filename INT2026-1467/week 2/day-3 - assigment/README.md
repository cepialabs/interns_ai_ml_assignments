# 🛒 Customer Purchase Amount Analysis using Probability & Distribution

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **customer purchase behavior** using **probability theory and statistical distributions**.
The analysis focuses on understanding spending patterns, identifying high-value purchase probabilities,
and comparing simulated sales data with a theoretical normal distribution.

This project has been customized and executed as part of my **AI/ML internship assignments**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize customer purchase amounts using a histogram
- Fit a normal distribution to simulated purchase data
- Calculate the probability of customers spending above a defined threshold
- Compare simulated data with theoretical distribution curves
- Apply probability concepts in a real-world business scenario

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
- **Type:** Simulated customer purchase data
- **Number of customers:** 1000
- **Mean purchase amount:** ₹600
- **Standard deviation:** ₹120
- Negative purchase values were removed to maintain realistic constraints

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (stats)

---

## 📈 Key Steps Performed
1. Generated customer purchase data using a normal distribution
2. Cleaned the data by removing invalid values
3. Visualized the distribution using histograms and curves
4. Computed probability metrics for high-value purchases
5. Interpreted results for business decision-making

---

## 📊 Insights
- Most customers spend close to the average purchase value
- A smaller group of customers contributes to high-value purchases
- Probability analysis helps identify premium customer segments

# Why I Want to Build a Career in AI/ML

I want to build a career in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning because it allows me to solve real-world problems using data and logic. AI/ML helps transform raw data into meaningful insights, predictions, and intelligent systems that can improve decision-making and efficiency across industries.

I am particularly interested in AI/ML because it combines programming, mathematics, and problem-solving. Working with data, building models, and continuously improving their performance motivates me to learn more and grow technically.

Through this journey, my goal is to develop strong fundamentals in data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and real-world implementation. I aim to become an AI/ML engineer who builds reliable, ethical, and impactful solutions.

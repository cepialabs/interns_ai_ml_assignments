This repository contains two complete machine learning projects demonstrating both
**supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques.

---

## 📂 Projects Included

### ✅ 1) House Price Prediction (Regression)
- ML Type: Supervised Learning
- Task: Regression
- Models Used:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor

#### Key Steps
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling and pipelines
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison using MAE, RMSE, and R²

---

### ✅ 2) Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- ML Type: Unsupervised Learning
- Task: Clustering
- Model Used: KMeans

#### Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Optimal cluster selection (Elbow & Silhouette)
- KMeans clustering
- PCA-based cluster visualization
- Cluster interpretation

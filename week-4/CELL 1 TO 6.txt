🔹 1. Data Handling & Visualization
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

✅ numpy
Used for numerical operations
Works with arrays and mathematical computations
Example: handling feature matrices

✅ matplotlib.pyplot
Used for basic data visualization
Creating plots like line charts, histograms, scatter plots

✅ seaborn
Built on matplotlib
Used for more advanced and attractive statistical visualizations
👉 In short: These libraries help us analyze and visualize data.



🔹 2. Data Splitting & Validation
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score

✅ train_test_split
Splits data into:
Training set (to train the model)
Testing set (to evaluate performance)

✅ cross_val_score
Performs cross-validation
Gives a more reliable performance estimate
👉 These ensure our model generalizes well.


🔹 3. Data Preprocessing
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

✅ StandardScaler
Standardizes numerical features
Scales data to mean = 0 and std = 1
Important for models like Logistic Regression

✅ OneHotEncoder
Converts categorical variables into numerical format

✅ ColumnTransformer
Applies different transformations to different columns
Example: scale numerical columns
Encode categorical columns

✅ Pipeline
Automates workflow:
Preprocessing → Model Training
Keeps code clean and prevents data leakage
👉 This section prepares raw data for machine learning.




🔹 4. Model Evaluation Metrics
from sklearn.metrics import (
    accuracy_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix,
    mean_squared_error, r2_score
)


These are used to evaluate model performance.
For Classification:
accuracy_score → % of correct predictions
f1_score → Balance between precision and recall
confusion_matrix → Shows correct & incorrect classifications

For Regression:
mean_squared_error (MSE) → Measures prediction error
r2_score → How well the model explains variance

👉 These help us measure how good the model is.




🔹 5. Machine Learning Models
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor
from xgboost import XGBClassifier, XGBRegressor


This project supports both classification and regression.

🔸 Linear Models
LogisticRegression → Classification
LinearRegression → Regression

🔸 Ensemble Models
RandomForestClassifier
RandomForestRegressor
Combine multiple decision trees
More powerful & robust

🔸 XGBoost Models
XGBClassifier
XGBRegressor
Advanced gradient boosting
Often gives high performance

👉 Multiple models allow comparison and performance optimization.



🔹 6. Suppressing Warnings
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")


Hides warning messages

Makes output cleaner for presentation
⚠️ Should be used carefully in production

“This code initializes all the required libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation. It prepares a complete machine learning workflow supporting both classification and regression using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.”



CELL-2

✅ 1. Load the Dataset
df = pd.read_csv("customer_churn_ml.csv")

pd stands for Pandas (a data analysis library).
read_csv() loads a CSV file into a DataFrame.
"customer_churn_ml.csv" is the dataset file.
The data is stored in a variable called df.

👉 In simple words:
We are importing the customer churn dataset into Python for analysis.

✅ 2. View the First Few Rows
df.head()


head() displays the first 5 rows of the dataset.
Helps us:
Understand column names
Check data structure
Preview sample records

👉 This is used for initial data inspection.

🔹 What is a DataFrame?

A DataFrame is:
A table-like structure
Rows = observations (customers)
Columns = features (age, contract type, charges, churn, etc.)

🔹 How to Explain in One Sentence (For Slide)
“This code loads the customer churn dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and displays the first five rows to understand the data structure.”




CELL-3

🔹 What This Code Does

df.info() provides a summary of the DataFrame structure.

It displays:
✅ 1. Number of Rows (Entries)
Total number of records in the dataset
(e.g., number of customers)

✅ 2. Column Names
Lists all feature names

✅ 3. Data Types of Each Column
Examples:
int64 → integers
float64 → decimal numbers
object → categorical/text data
bool → True/False

This helps identify:
Numerical variables
Categorical variables

✅ 4. Non-Null Count
Shows how many values are not missing
Helps detect missing data

✅ 5. Memory Usage
Shows how much memory the dataset uses

🔹 Why This Is Important

df.info() helps us:
Understand the dataset structure
Detect missing values
Identify feature types
Prepare for preprocessing

🔹 How to Explain in One Sentence (For Slide)
“This command gives a structural summary of the dataset, including column names, data types, and missing values.”




CELL-4

🔹 What This Code Does

df.describe() generates statistical summary values for all numerical columns in the dataset.

It automatically calculates:
✅ Count
Number of non-missing values

✅ Mean
Average value

✅ Standard Deviation (std)
Measures how spread out the values are

✅ Minimum (min)
Smallest value

✅ 25% (1st Quartile)
25% of values fall below this number

✅ 50% (Median)
Middle value of the data

✅ 75% (3rd Quartile)
75% of values fall below this number

✅ Maximum (max)
Largest value

🔹 Why This Is Important

This helps us:
Understand data distribution
Detect outliers
Check value ranges
Identify unusual patterns
Get a quick overview before modeling

🔹 Example (Customer Churn Context)

For example:
It may show average monthly charges
Average tenure of customers
Minimum and maximum contract duration

🔹 One-Sentence Slide Explanation

“This command provides a statistical summary of numerical features, including mean, standard deviation, and value ranges.”



CELL-5

🔹 What This Code Does

This command checks for missing values in the dataset.

It works in two steps:

✅ 1. df.isnull()
Checks every cell in the DataFrame
Returns:
True if the value is missing (NaN)
False if the value is present

✅ 2. .sum()
Counts the total number of True values in each column
Since True = 1 and False = 0, summing gives the total missing values per column

🔹 Output

The result shows:
Each column name
The number of missing values in that column


🔹 Why This Is Important

Handling missing data is critical because:
Many machine learning models cannot handle missing values
Missing data can affect model accuracy
Helps decide whether to:
Remove rows
Fill missing values (imputation)
Drop columns

🔹 One-Sentence Slide Explanation

“This command identifies and counts missing values in each column of the dataset.”




CELL-6


🔹 What This Code Does

This code performs feature engineering — creating new meaningful variables from existing ones.

✅ 1. Creating avg_monthly_spend
df["avg_monthly_spend"] = df["total_charges"] / (df["tenure_months"] + 1)


Calculates the average spending per month for each customer.
Formula:

Average Monthly Spend=Total Charges
		     --------------
		    Tenure (Months)+1
	​

🔎 Why add +1?

Prevents division by zero
Handles cases where tenure might be 0 months
👉 This helps normalize total spending over time.

✅ 2. Creating tickets_per_month
df["tickets_per_month"] = df["support_tickets"] / (df["tenure_months"] + 1)


Calculates average number of support tickets per month
Shows how frequently a customer contacts support
👉 This helps measure customer engagement or dissatisfaction rate.

🔹 Why This Is Important

Feature engineering:
Improves model performance
Makes patterns easier to detect
Creates more meaningful metrics than raw totals

Instead of using:
Total charges
Total support tickets

We now use:
Spending rate
Support usage rate
Which are more predictive for churn analysis.

🔹 One-Sentence Slide Explanation
“This step creates new features that calculate average monthly spending and support ticket frequency to improve model performance.”

# 🏠 House Prices Prediction - ML Mini Project

## Objective

Predict house prices using: - Logistic Regression (baseline adapted for
classification example) - Random Forest Regressor

## Workflow

1.  Data Loading
2.  EDA
3.  Feature Engineering
4.  Model Training
5.  5-Fold & 10-Fold Cross Validation
6.  Model Comparison
7.  Insights on Stability & Generalization

## Models Compared

-   Logistic Regression (if classification threshold applied)
-   Random Forest

## Evaluation Metrics

-   RMSE
-   R² Score
-   Cross-Validation Mean & Std

## Insights

-   Random Forest expected to outperform baseline in non-linear
    patterns.
-   Cross-validation standard deviation indicates stability.

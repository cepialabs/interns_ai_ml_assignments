# 📊 Marketing & Sales Data Analysis  
## Correlation vs Causation Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Marketing & Sales dataset** to study the relationship between advertising spend and sales performance. The focus is on understanding **correlation**, distinguishing it from **causal reasoning**, and identifying **possible confounding factors** that influence sales outcomes.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Correlation measures the strength of association between advertising spend and sales.
- Correlation alone does not prove causation.
- Sales may increase due to external or hidden factors.
- A single data record cannot produce meaningful correlation values.
- Proper causal inference requires controlled experiments or larger datasets.

## ⚠️ Correlation vs Causation
- **Correlation** shows that two variables move together.
- **Causation** proves that one variable directly affects another.
- High correlation does not guarantee a cause‑and‑effect relationship.

## 🔍 Possible Confounders
- Seasonality (festivals, holidays)
- Brand popularity
- Discounts and promotions
- Product quality
- Competitor marketing activity
- Economic conditions

These factors may affect both advertising spend and sales simultaneously.

📊 Customer Purchase Amount Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchase amounts using statistical and probabilistic techniques.
The goal is to understand spending behavior, model it using a normal distribution, and validate the model using simulated sales data.

🎯 Objectives

Plot a histogram of customer purchase amounts

Fit and visualize a normal distribution

Calculate the probability of a customer spending above a given threshold

Simulate random sales data and compare it with the theoretical distribution

🗂️ Dataset Description

Dataset Name: Customer Purchase Amounts

Feature Used:

purchase_amount – Amount spent by a customer

Data is generated/simulated assuming real-world purchase behavior.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

SciPy

📈 Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Histogram & Normal Distribution Fit

Purchase amounts are visualized using a histogram

A normal probability density function (PDF) is fitted using mean and standard deviation

2️⃣ Probability Analysis

Calculated the probability of a customer spending above a given threshold using the cumulative distribution function (CDF)

3️⃣ Simulation & Comparison

Random sales data is simulated using the same statistical parameters

Compared actual data vs simulated data to validate assumptions

🔍 Key Insights

Customer purchase behavior approximately follows a normal distribution

Statistical modeling helps in:

Sales forecasting

Customer segmentation

Marketing decision-making

Simulated data closely matches real data, confirming model reliability

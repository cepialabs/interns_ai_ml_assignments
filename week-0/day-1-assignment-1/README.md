## 🧠 Why I Want to Build a Career in AI/ML

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are transforming the world in every field, from healthcare and agriculture to education and business. I want to build my career in AI/ML because I enjoy working with data, logic, and technology to solve real-world problems.

AI systems can help make better decisions, automate tasks, and improve people's lives. I am passionate about learning how intelligent systems work and how they can be built using programming and data. I believe AI/ML is the future, and I want to continuously learn, build projects, and contribute to meaningful and impactful solutions using this technology.

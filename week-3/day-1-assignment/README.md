## Assignment Overview  
This assignment focuses on applying Supervised Learning (Regression) and  
Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) techniques on real-world datasets.

Two machine learning problems are solved:

1. Housing Price Prediction – using supervised Learning  
2. Customer Segmentation – using clustering

- Evaluate model performance  

### Customer Segmentation Dataset (Clustering)
- Group customers into segments  
- Identify hidden patterns in data  
- Understand unsupervised learning

## Key Concepts  

### Supervised Learning (Regression)  
Supervised learning uses labeled data.  
The model learns from known outputs to predict future values.

Example:  
Predicting house price from size, location, and number of rooms.

---

### Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)  
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data.  
The model finds hidden patterns or groups.

Example:  
Grouping customers based on income and spending behavior.

---

## Results  

### Housing Dataset  
- Model predicts house prices effectively  
- Shows relationship between features and price  

### Customer Segmentation  
- Customers grouped into meaningful clusters  
- Helps understand customer behavior  

---

## Conclusion  
This assignment shows how different machine learning techniques solve different problems.

Regression is used for prediction.  
Clustering is used for discovering patterns.

Both are important in real-world data science.

# 🔹 Assignment 1: House Price Prediction  
**Dataset:** Housing Dataset  
**Machine Learning Type:** Supervised Learning  
**Task:** Predict house prices  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this assignment is to build a machine learning model that can **predict house prices** based on given features such as area, number of bedrooms, and other housing attributes.

Since the dataset contains **labeled output (price)** and the target variable is **continuous**, this problem is categorized as a **Supervised Regression problem**.

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. Load the housing dataset
2. Perform data preprocessing and handle missing values
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a regression model
5. Predict house prices on test data
6. Evaluate model performance using regression metrics

---

## 🛠 Algorithm Used
- **Linear Regression**

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The supervised regression model successfully learns the relationship between housing features and prices. Linear Regression is suitable for predicting continuous values such as house prices.

# 🔹 Assignment 2: Customer Segmentation  
**Dataset:** Customer Purchase Dataset  
**Machine Learning Type:** Unsupervised Learning  
**Task:** Cluster customers based on purchase behavior  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
The goal of this assignment is to **group customers into meaningful segments** based on their purchasing behavior.  
The dataset includes information such as purchase amount and review rating, but **no labeled output** is provided.

Therefore, this problem is classified as an **Unsupervised Clustering problem**.

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. Load the customer dataset
2. Select numerical features related to purchase behavior
3. Handle missing values
4. Normalize the data
5. Apply clustering algorithm
6. Analyze and visualize customer segments

---

## 🛠 Algorithm Used
- **K-Means Clustering**

---

## 📊 Features Used for Clustering
- Purchase Amount (USD)
- Review Rating

---

## 📌 Outcome
Customers are grouped into different clusters such as:
- Low spending customers
- Medium spending customers
- High spending customers

These segments help businesses in **targeted marketing and customer retention strategies**.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering effectively groups customers based on purchase behavior. This unsupervised learning technique helps uncover hidden patterns without predefined labels.

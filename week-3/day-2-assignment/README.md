## Title  
House Price Prediction & Email Spam Detection using Logistic Regression

---
## Dataset Resource: Kaggle
**URL for Housing dataset** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=housing+
**URL for Email dataset** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishabharathi/email-spam-dataset

## Objective  

The objective of this assignment is to understand the working of basic Machine Learning algorithms by implementing them **from scratch without using sklearn**.

This assignment includes two main tasks:

1. House Price Prediction (Regression)  
2. Email Spam Detection (Classification)

## Problem 1: House Price Prediction  

### Description  
In this task, house prices are predicted using features such as area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, parking availability, and furnishing status.

### Methodology  
- Data preprocessing  
- Conversion of categorical data into numerical form  
- Feature normalization  
- Implementation of Linear Regression  
- Training using Gradient Descent  
- Prediction using learned weights  

### Output  
The model predicts approximate house prices for given input features.

## Problem 2: Email Spam Detection  

### Description  
This task classifies emails as either **Spam** or **Not Spam** based on the content of the email.

### Methodology  
- Text preprocessing  
- Bag of Words technique for vectorization  
- Implementation of Logistic Regression  
- Use of Sigmoid function for probability calculation  
- Training using Gradient Descent  
- Classification based on probability threshold  

### Output  
The model predicts whether a given email is spam or not.

## Technologies Used  

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Learning Outcomes  

Through this assignment, I learned:

- Difference between regression and classification  
- How gradient descent updates weights  
- Working of sigmoid function  
- How accuracy is calculated manually  
- How to build ML models from scratch

## Conclusion  

This assignment helped me gain a strong understanding of the internal working of Machine Learning algorithms instead of relying on external libraries.

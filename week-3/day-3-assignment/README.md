## Objective  
The objective of this assignment is to understand how classification algorithms work internally by implementing them from scratch using the sklearn library.

This assignment focuses on:
- Decision Tree Classification  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## Problem 1: Decision Tree Classification  

### Description  
In this task, a simple Decision Tree classifier is implemented to predict class labels based on feature values using rule-based splitting.

### Methodology  
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature selection  
- Splitting data using threshold conditions  
- Predicting output class labels  
- Handling errors such as empty features and undefined trees  

### Output  
The model predicts the class labels for test data using decision rules.

## Problem 2: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification  

### Description  
This task classifies data points by finding the K nearest neighbors based on distance and assigning the majority class.

### Methodology  
- Feature normalization  
- Euclidean distance calculation  
- Selection of K nearest neighbors  
- Majority voting for class prediction  
- Manual accuracy calculation  

### Output  
The model predicts class labels and computes accuracy without using sklearn.

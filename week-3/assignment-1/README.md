# 📊 Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **customer segmentation** using **unsupervised machine learning**.  
Customers are grouped based on their **purchase behavior** without using any predefined labels.

---

## 📁 Dataset
**Type:** Unlabelled customer behavior data

### Features:
- `annual_spend` – Total yearly spending
- `purchase_frequency` – Number of purchases per year
- `avg_basket_value` – Average value per purchase
- `website_visits` – Engagement level

> There is **no target/label column**, which makes this an **unsupervised learning** problem.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Cluster customers into meaningful groups
- Identify patterns such as low‑value, medium‑value, and high‑value customers
- Support business decisions like targeted marketing and personalization

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- **Feature selection** (behavioral attributes)
- **Standardization** using `StandardScaler`
- **K‑Means clustering** to form customer segments
- **Visualization** of clusters

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit‑learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**

---

## 📊 Output
- Each customer is assigned a **cluster label**
- Clusters represent groups with similar purchasing behavior
- Visual plot shows clear separation between customer segments

---

## 📁 Project Structure

---

## 📈 Key Takeaways
- Unsupervised learning works without labelled data
- K‑Means automatically discovers hidden patterns
- Customer segmentation helps improve marketing efficiency

---

## 📜 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **unsupervised clustering** can be used to segment customers based on behavior. Such segmentation enables businesses to better understand their customers and design data‑driven strategies.

# Spam Email Classification using KNN and Decision Tree

## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying spam emails using machine learning techniques.  
Email text is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization and classified using KNN and Decision Tree algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:
- `text` – email content
- `spam` – target label (1 = Spam, 0 = Not Spam)

## Algorithms Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow
1. Load and prepare the dataset  
2. Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train KNN and Decision Tree models  
5. Evaluate models using accuracy score  
6. Predict spam for new email text  

## Result
Both KNN and Decision Tree models successfully classify spam and non-spam emails and provide prediction results with accuracy scores.

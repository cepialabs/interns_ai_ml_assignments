## 🎯 Objectives
1. Analyze the **correlation between ad spend and sales**
2. Visualize relationships using **heatmaps and scatter plots**
3. Compare **correlation vs causal reasoning**
4. Discuss **possible confounding factors**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📈 Analysis Performed
- Computed correlation matrix between ad spend channels and sales
- Visualized correlations using a heatmap
- Created scatter plots for:
  - TV vs Sales
  - Radio vs Sales
  - Social Media vs Sales
- Interpreted the results in terms of business understanding

---

## 🧠 Correlation vs Causation
Correlation indicates a relationship between variables but does not prove that one causes the other.  
An increase in sales alongside increased ad spend does not guarantee that advertising alone caused the increase.

---

## ⚠️ Possible Confounding Factors
- Seasonal demand (festivals, holidays)
- Discounts or pricing changes
- Brand reputation
- Competitor marketing strategies
- Influencer type and reach
- Economic conditions

These factors may influence sales independently of advertising spend.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The analysis shows relationships between marketing spend and sales, but further analysis such as controlled experiments or regression modeling is required to establish causality.

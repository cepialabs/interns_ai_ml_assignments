# Advanced Machine Learning Project

## Objective
Apply advanced machine learning techniques to maximize model performance on a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
Customer churn and lifetime value dataset with demographic, usage, and contract features.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Linear Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- Classification: Accuracy, F1-score
- Regression: RMSE, R²

## Key Features
- Feature engineering
- Categorical encoding
- Ensemble models
- Cross-validation
- Interpretability plots

## How to Run
1. Install requirements  
   `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn`
2. Open `ml_project.ipynb`
3. Run all cells

## Results
Ensemble models consistently outperform baseline models across tasks.

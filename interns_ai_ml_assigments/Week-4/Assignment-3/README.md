Here is your House Price Prediction (Random Forest) README rewritten in the same exact style 👇

🏠 House Price Prediction using Random Forest & Linear Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building regression models to predict house prices using property features.
It demonstrates how ensemble learning methods like Random Forest can outperform traditional Linear Regression in predicting housing prices.

📂 Dataset

House Prices Dataset

Original Features:

price (target variable)

🔧 Data Preprocessing

Removed unnecessary columns (id, date, zipcode)

Checked and handled missing values

Split dataset into training and testing sets (80% – 20%)

🧠 Models Used
🔹 Linear Regression

Used as a baseline model

Evaluated using R² score

Helps understand linear relationship between features and price

🔹 Random Forest Regressor

Ensemble model based on multiple decision trees

Reduces overfitting compared to single tree models

Provides feature importance scores

Achieved higher R² score compared to Linear Regression

🎯 Objectives

Train and evaluate regression models

Compare performance using R² score

Analyze feature importance

Understand which features most influence house prices

🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

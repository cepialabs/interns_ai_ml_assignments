# Customer Purchase Amount Analysis

📅 **Date:** 30 January 2026  

## Project Description
This project analyzes customer purchase amounts using statistical and probability-based techniques.  
The objective is to understand customer spending behavior by visualizing purchase distributions, fitting a normal distribution, estimating probabilities above a spending threshold, and validating results through simulated data.

The analysis is implemented using Python and is suitable for academic assignments and beginner-to-intermediate data analysis projects.

## Dataset Source
**Customer Shopping Dataset (Kaggle)**  
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmettahiraslan/customer-shopping-dataset  

The dataset contains customer shopping transactions, including product price and quantity purchased.  
Total purchase amount is calculated as:

## Objectives
- Plot a histogram of customer purchase amounts
- Fit a normal distribution to the data
- Calculate the probability of a customer spending above a given threshold
- Simulate random sales data using the theoretical distribution
- Compare actual and simulated data using statistical methods (Histogram and CDF)

---

## Methodology
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Compute total purchase amount per transaction
3. Estimate mean and standard deviation
4. Visualize data using histogram and normal distribution curve
5. Calculate probability using the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
6. Simulate random sales data
7. Compare actual and simulated distributions

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Key Findings
- Customer purchase amounts follow an approximately normal distribution
- Probability models help identify high-value customers
- Simulated sales data closely matches actual purchase behavior
- Normal distribution is suitable for modeling customer spending patterns

## 🧠 Project Description
This project analyzes customer purchase behavior using statistical techniques.  
The main objectives of the assignment are:

1. Plot a **histogram of customer purchase amounts**
2. Fit and visualize the **normal distribution**
3. Identify the **probability of a customer spending above a given threshold**
4. **Simulate random sales data** using the same distribution parameters
5. Compare **simulated data with the theoretical normal distribution**

All analysis is implemented using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**, without relying on external statistical libraries like SciPy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Math (built-in)

---

## ✅ Outcome
The notebook provides clear visualizations and statistical insights into customer spending patterns, demonstrating understanding of probability distributions and data simulation.

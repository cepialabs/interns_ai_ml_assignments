# 📊 Marketing & Sales Data Analysis Project

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **insight generation** from a Marketing & Sales dataset. The goal is to understand customer behaviour, sales performance, and marketing effectiveness using data-driven techniques. The analysis helps uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can support better business decisions.

The project is implemented using **Python** and common data science libraries, and all analysis is documented step-by-step in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

## Project Description  
Dataset: Email marketing campaign  

This project focuses on analyzing an email marketing campaign using probability concepts.  
The objective of this assignment is to calculate:  
- Probability that a user clicks an email  
- Probability that a user converts given they clicked  
- Conditional probability tables and visualization  

The analysis helps in understanding customer behavior and measuring the effectiveness of email campaigns using data analytics techniques.

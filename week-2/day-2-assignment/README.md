# 📧 Email Marketing Campaign – Probability Analysis

**Date:** **29 January 2026**

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project applies **probability and conditional probability concepts** to a real-world **email marketing dataset**.
The objective is to analyze user engagement behavior and demonstrate how statistical reasoning supports **data-driven marketing decisions**.

The analysis is performed using **Python and Jupyter Notebook**.

## 📂 Dataset Information

* **Dataset Name:** Email CTR Prediction
* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Dataset Link:**
  [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sk4467/email-ctr-prediction?utm_source]
* **File Format:** CSV

This dataset contains features related to email campaigns and user interaction indicators used for click-through rate analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Estimate the **probability of email clicks**
* Analyze **conditional probabilities** based on campaign features
* Construct **conditional probability tables**
* Visualize engagement patterns
* Interpret probability results in a marketing context

---

## ⚠️ Assumption

The dataset does not contain an explicit click or conversion outcome variable.

> **Assumption Used:**
> The column `target_audience` is treated as a **proxy for user click/response**, where:
>
> * `1` → User engagement (click)
> * `0` → No engagement

This assumption is clearly stated and used **only for analytical and educational purposes**.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Identification of a response proxy variable
3. Calculation of:

   * Overall click probability
   * Conditional probabilities (e.g., click given discount)
4. Construction of conditional probability tables
5. Visualization of probability distributions
6. Interpretation of results for marketing insights

# Customer Purchase Analysis using Normal Distribution

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchase amounts using statistical techniques.  
It demonstrates how to:

- Visualize customer spending using a histogram  
- Fit a normal distribution to purchase data  
- Calculate the probability of customers spending above a given threshold  
- Simulate random sales data and compare it with the theoretical distribution  

The analysis is implemented in **Python** using common data science libraries.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset represents **customer purchase amounts**
- In this project, data is **simulated** using a normal distribution
- Negative purchase values are removed to ensure realism

You can replace the simulated data with real purchase data if available.

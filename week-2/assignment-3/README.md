📊 Customer Purchase Amount Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase amounts using statistical and probabilistic techniques.
The main objective is to understand customer spending behavior, model it using a normal distribution, and validate the model through simulated sales data.

🎯 Objectives

Plot a histogram of customer purchase amounts

Fit and visualize a normal (Gaussian) distribution

Calculate the probability of a customer spending above a specified threshold

Simulate random sales data and compare it with the theoretical distribution

🗂️ Dataset Description

Dataset Name: Customer Purchase Amounts

Feature Used:

purchase_amount – Represents the amount spent by a customer per transaction

The dataset is generated/simulated to reflect realistic customer purchase behavior commonly observed in retail and e-commerce scenarios.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python – Programming language

NumPy – Numerical computations

Pandas – Data handling and manipulation

Matplotlib – Data visualization

SciPy – Statistical analysis and probability distributions

📈 Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Histogram & Normal Distribution Fit

Customer purchase amounts are visualized using a histogram

The mean and standard deviation are calculated

A normal probability density function (PDF) is fitted and overlaid on the histogram to model the data distribution

2️⃣ Probability Analysis

The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is used to calculate the probability of a customer spending above a given threshold

This helps estimate the likelihood of high-value purchases

3️⃣ Simulation & Comparison

Random sales data is simulated using the same statistical parameters (mean and standard deviation)

Simulated data is compared with the theoretical normal distribution

This comparison helps validate the assumption that customer purchases follow a normal distribution

🔍 Key Insights

Customer purchase behavior approximately follows a normal distribution

Statistical modeling provides valuable insights for:

Sales forecasting

Customer segmentation

Marketing and pricing strategies

Simulated data closely aligns with real data, confirming the reliability of the model

📎 Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how statistical and probabilistic methods can be effectively applied to customer purchase data.
By combining visualization, probability estimation, and simulation, the project offers a strong foundation for data-driven business decision-making.

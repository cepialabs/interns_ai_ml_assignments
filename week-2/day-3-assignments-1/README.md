# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis 📊

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **data analysis and visualization project** using a **Customer Purchase dataset**.
The objective of this assignment is to **analyze customer demographics and feedback data** to understand purchasing behavior and derive meaningful insights.

The analysis focuses on understanding:

* Customer purchase distribution
* Impact of age on purchasing behavior
* Gender-based purchase patterns
* Effect of customer reviews on purchase decisions
* Overall purchase probability

The entire workflow is implemented using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Customer Purchase dataset**, which contains demographic details and purchase outcomes for customers.

### Key Columns:

* **CustomerID** – Unique customer identifier
* **Age** – Age of the customer
* **Gender** – Gender of the customer
* **Education** – Education level
* **Review** – Customer review category (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent)
* **Purchased** – Purchase decision (Yes / No)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

This project addresses the following analysis tasks:

1. **Purchase Distribution Analysis**
   Analyze how many customers purchased vs did not purchase.

2. **Demographic Analysis**
   Study purchase behavior across age groups and gender.

3. **Review Impact Analysis**
   Understand how customer reviews influence purchase decisions.

4. **Probability Analysis**
   Calculate the probability of a customer making a purchase.

  * Loaded the dataset and reviewed structure, data types, and summary statistics.

* **Purchase Distribution Analysis**

  * Visualized the count of customers who purchased vs did not purchase.

* **Gender-wise Purchase Analysis**

  * Compared purchase behavior across male and female customers.

* **Age-based Analysis**

  * Analyzed average age differences between purchasing and non-purchasing customers.

* **Review Impact Analysis**

  * Studied how customer reviews affect purchasing decisions.

* **Probability Calculation**

  * Computed the probability of a customer making a purchase.

# Marketing & Sales Data Analysis 📊

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **data analysis and visualization project** using a **Marketing & Sales dataset**.  
The objective of this assignment is to **analyze the relationship between advertising spend and sales performance** and understand how different marketing channels impact revenue.

The analysis focuses on:

* Correlation between advertising spend and sales  
* Comparison between correlation and causal reasoning  
* Identification of possible confounding factors  
* Visualization of relationships across marketing channels  

The entire workflow is implemented using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Marketing & Sales dataset**, which contains advertising expenditures across multiple channels and corresponding sales values.

### Key Columns:

* **TV** – TV advertising spend  
* **Radio** – Radio advertising spend  
* **Social Media** – Social media advertising spend  
* **Influencer** – Influencer category (Mega, Macro, Micro, Nano)  
* **Sales** – Total sales revenue  

📌 Only numerical columns (TV, Radio, Social Media, Sales) are used for correlation analysis.

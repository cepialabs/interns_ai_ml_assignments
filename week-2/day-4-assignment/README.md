---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between **advertising spend** and **sales** using a marketing dataset.
The primary goal is to examine **correlation**, explain why **correlation does not imply causation**, and discuss **possible confounding factors** that may influence sales outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze the correlation between advertising spend and sales
* Visualize relationships using scatter plots
* Compare correlation with causal reasoning
* Identify potential confounding variables affecting sales

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

* **Dataset Name:** Advertising Spend vs Sales
* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Link:** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsahan/advertising-spend-vs-sales)

### Key Variables

* **TV:** TV advertising spend
* **Radio:** Radio advertising spend
* **Newspaper:** Newspaper advertising spend
* **Sales:** Product sales

---

## 🧪 Methodology

1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Computed correlation between advertising channels and sales
3. Created scatter plots to visualize relationships
4. Interpreted results using statistical reasoning
5. Discussed why correlation does not indicate causation

---

## 📈 Key Findings

* TV advertising shows the strongest positive correlation with sales
* Radio advertising shows moderate correlation
* Newspaper advertising shows weak correlation
* Strong correlation does not confirm a causal relationship

---

## ⚠️ Correlation vs Causation

Although advertising spend and sales are correlated, this does not mean advertising spend directly causes increased sales.
Sales may also be influenced by external or unobserved factors.

---

## 🔍 Possible Confounders

* Seasonality (festive or peak sales periods)
* Brand awareness
* Pricing strategies and promotions
* Market competition
* Consumer purchasing power

These factors may affect both advertising spend and sales, leading to misleading correlations.

---

## 🚫 Limitations

* Observational dataset
* No experimental or time-series data
* Confounders not explicitly measured
* Causal inference not established

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib


## 📌 Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates a positive correlation between advertising spend and sales.
However, due to confounding variables and the absence of controlled experimentation, causal conclusions cannot be drawn.
Further analysis using experimental or causal methods would be required to establish causality.

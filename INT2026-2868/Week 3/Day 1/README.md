Week 3 : Day 1 : Assignment 1 
# Housing Price Prediction & Customer Segmentation

This Assignment demonstrates two fundamental Machine Learning techniques using Python:
Supervised Learning (Regression) and Unsupervised Learning (Clustering).

## Project Overview

### 1. Housing Price Prediction
- Learning Type: Supervised Learning
- Problem Type: Regression
- Objective: Predict house prices based on housing features
- Algorithm Used: Linear Regression

### 2. Customer Segmentation
- Learning Type: Unsupervised Learning
- Problem Type: Clustering
- Objective: Group customers based on purchase behavior
- Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## Dataset Description

### Housing Dataset (House_price.csv)
- size: Size of the house
- bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
- bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
- price: House price (target variable)

### Customer Dataset (customer_segmentation_data.csv)
- Income_Level: Customer annual income
- Coverage_Amount: Customer spending behavior score

---
## Model Evaluation

### Regression Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

### Clustering Output
- Customers grouped into clusters
- Visualized using scatter plots

---

## Learning Outcomes

## Project Overview

### 1. Housing Price Prediction
- Learning Type: Supervised Learning
- Problem Type: Regression
- Objective: Predict house prices based on housing features
- Algorithm Used: Linear Regression

### 2. Customer Segmentation
- Learning Type: Unsupervised Learning
- Problem Type: Clustering
- Objective: Group customers based on purchase behavior
- Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project 📊

This Assignment demonstrates a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** workflow using Python.  
The goal is to understand, clean, analyze, and visualize a dataset to extract meaningful insights.

## 📂 Project Objectives
- Load and understand the dataset
- Clean the dataset thoroughly
- Perform meaningful exploratory analysis
- Create at least six visualizations
- Extract actionable insights
- Prepare the project for GitHub

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## 🔍 Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding
- Checked dataset shape and structure
- Reviewed column data types
- Identified missing values

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate rows
- Filled missing numeric values with median
- Filled missing categorical values with mode
- Standardized column names

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Analysis
- Generated summary statistics
- Analyzed distributions and relationships between variables

### 4️⃣ Visualizations Created
1. Histogram of numeric feature
2. Boxplot to detect outliers
3. Count plot for categorical data
4. Correlation heatmap
5. Scatter plot between numeric variables
6. Pairplot for multivariate analysis

## 📊 Key Insights
1. Numeric features show noticeable skewness and outliers.
2. Certain variables have strong correlations, indicating potential predictive power.
3. Some categories dominate the dataset, creating class imbalance.
4. Relationships between key numeric variables suggest linear trends.
5. Cleaning significantly improved data consistency and quality.
